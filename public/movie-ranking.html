<h1>The Best Movies According to Katie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Princess Diaries</h3>
<p>This is a sweet movie, very well done, and comforting in a way.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>I think this movie, the series actually, was well before its time. I rewatch it every so often because I find something else cool about it the older I get.</p>
<h3>Legally Blonde</h3>
<p>I think I would never get tired of this movie. It is so empowering and just a feel good movie.</p>
